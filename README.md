# Web Development for Journalists

This is all info relevant to my Spring 2023 class at CUNY Journalism School, which I'm calling Web Development for Journalists. Kind of boring but makes the point clearly I think.

Anyway, [here's the syllabus](SYLLABUS.md).

And here are the slides:

- Week 1: [HTML](slides/html/week-1.html) | [Markdown](slides/markdown/week-1.md)
- Week 2: [HTML](slides/html/week-2.html) | [Markdown](slides/markdown/week-2.md)
