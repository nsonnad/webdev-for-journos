# Web development for journalists

- JOUR 73361-01, Spring 2023
- Tuesdays 6:00-8:50pm on gather.town
- Nikhil Sonnad (nikhil.sonnad@journalism.cuny.edu)

_Note: This syllabus is a dynamic document and will change as the semester goes on._

## Course description

I apologize if the title of this course makes it sound a little boring. It's because the topic here is a bit hard to pin down. What we will be learning encompasses data analysis, data visualization, reporting with data, and writing code. But throughout all of that the medium and the message will be the same. The medium being the most all-powerful and ubiqitous of them all (i.e. the web). The message, important and interesting truths relevant to the public interest, stated as clearly and creatively as possible (i.e. journalism).

Hence, "web development for journalists."

The world of web development changes quickly and often. So, rather than just learn the state of things as they are today, we are going to focus on learning conceptual building blocks that will allow you to make cool stuff, but more importantly, to continue making cool stuff even as technologies and tools evolve.

In this course we will learn by doing. We will learn how to think like programmers, and use that mode of thinking to enhance the stories we want to tell with visuals, dynamic data, animations, and interactivity, infusing our journalism with statistical rigor, aesthetic delight, and creativity. To do all of that, we'll use the technologies that underlie the web: HTML, CSS, and the programming language JavaScript.

## Course learning objectives

Students who successfully complete this course will gain experience in:

- Exploring non-traditional ways of telling stories
- Understanding the (limitless) potential of the web as a storytelling medium
- Applying a programmer's mindset toward journalistic goals
- Building dynamic, data-driven web graphics and visualizations
- What computer programming is, how it works, and how we can use it for all kinds of things
- Writing the kind of code that is used in the most modern and sophisticated newsrooms around
- Learning how to make use of the many, many (usually free) online resources that exist for improving your programming skills
- Making neat things with code

## The structure of this class

This course will be entirely remote, taking place in our virtual classroom on Gather. The class will consist of the following elements:

**Pre-Class Learning Modules / Homework:** You'll have material to absorb (read or watch and complete) prior to class. This can be done in your own time, and this material replaces the traditional "lecture." You'll also have to complete some exercises associated with the pre-class material.

**In-Class Exercises:** During class time, we'll first cover the key points from the pre-class learning modules. You'll also have a chance to ask any questions you might have. Then you'll be challenged to apply those lessons to more real-world, journalistic exercises.

**Assignments:** You will demonstrate that you can apply the pre-class and in-class material by completing two major assignments outside of class.

**Office Hours:** You'll have a weekly opportunity to meet with me, your Teaching Assistant and Professional Coaches to seek clarifications or to explore nuances. My office hours are Wednesdays, 3-5pm EST. They will be remote, in the Gather classroom.

## Class communications

- I'll try to respond to your questions within 12 hours, Monday through Friday. 
- [Slack](https://fundamentalsofdata.slack.com) is the best way to communicate in this course.
- During class, we will gather on [Gather](https://gather.town). This is also where office hours take place.
- You're always welcome to direct message me on Slack if you need to address a personal concern.

## Importance of diversity & inclusion

It's critical that students learn to include a diverse set of voices in their stories -- something that is often glossed over when telling stories through charts and graphics. You are encouraged to look for stories about and voices from communities that are underrepresented. Diversity and inclusion here refers to race, gender, age, people with disabilities, and those at various economic and education levels living across New York City.

## Land acknowledgment

This classroom, and the CUNY Craig Newmark School of Journalism, is situated on the island of Manhahtaan (Mannahatta) in Lenapehoking, the unceded homeland of the Lenape people. We honor the Lenape people of the past, present, and future, whose relationships to this land continue today. Words are useless without actions, and as such we will be donating a portion of our salary to the Lenape Center as rent for the use of this space.

## Assignments

1. Weekly exercises labelled "Homework" in the syllabus and pre-class learning modules
2. Assignment 1: Filterable table
3. Assignment 2: Custom data visualization project

## Grading rubric

Grading for individual assignments is based on the quality of the finished work:

| Grade | Quality |
| ----- | ------- |
| A     | Tells a compelling narrative clearly and convincingly, shows a deep understanding of the issues at hand, and demonstrates capacity with technical topics covered in this course.       |
| B     | Work that may be polished in its presentation and technical execution but lacking a compelling narrative, or vice versa, i.e. a strong narrative that is not well executed.    |
| C     | Work that leaves readers asking "what's the point of this?" and is also lacking in technical execution.        |
| D     | Work that has no discernable narrative, story, or point, and does not attempt to apply technical topics covered in the course.        |
| F      | Unacceptable work.         |
