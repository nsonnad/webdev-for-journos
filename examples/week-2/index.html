<p>Roses are a quintessential gift on Valentine's Day, and meaning has been attached to the popular flower for generations. </p>
<p>But what does the rose actually signify? And does that meaning change with the color?</p>
<p>Red roses are the most popular gift for Valentine's Day because they represent love and beauty. Giving someone a pink rose means that you admire them. Yellow, meanwhile, depending on who you give it to, can mean friendship or infidelity.</p>  
<p>Beyond roses, other flowers that work well as Valentine's Day gifts include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>pink peonies</li>
    <li>white chrysanthemums</li>
    <li>red tulips</li>
    <li>purple lilac</li>
</ul>
