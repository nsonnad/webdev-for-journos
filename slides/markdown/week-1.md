# what we're going to learn

---

# why the web?

Instead of other mediums like:

- Print
- Email (e.g. newsletters)
- Native apps
- Video
- Audio/Podcasts

---

# why the web?

No other mediums have all of these qualities:

- Highly versatile
- Multimedia
- Interactive
- Dynamic
- Ubiquitous

---

# by using the web our stories can:

- Reach most everyone
- Mix and match any formats we want (text, video, audio, graphics)
- Be customized for each reader
- Make use of many fun things web browsers can do

---

## key point of this class: experimenting with story _form_ given the versatility of the web

No longer any need to be constrained by the 800-word story structure.

---

# why web "development"?

That's just the term given to the field of making stuff for the web.

---

# so what is web "development"?

Basically, writing code that runs in web browsers. And to do that we just need three tools:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

---

# so, the point of this class

- learn how to make web browsers do what we want them to
- learn the specifically relevant-to-journalism webdev skill of data visualization
- use the flexibility/versatility of the web to expand our notion of a "story"
