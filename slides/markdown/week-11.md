# Turning our ideas into code~

# Share your visions

Let's go around the room:

1. Show us your sketch!
2. Tell: How are you making the important visible? What's the key point you want
   to show with your visualization?
3. What types of scales will you need to create?
4. What do others think? Anything missing? Questions that come up?

# Today's goals

1. Create a repo for your project
2. Copy the boilerplate html and JavaScript code from last week to load D3 and set
   up an SVG container with margins
3. Write code for all the scales you'll need for your visualization (feel free
   to copy code from last week)
4. Use the scales you created to draw axes

No actual data yet; just the foundation!

# For next week

Get your dataset ready for visualization

1. Do any data analysis, prep, cleanup, etc you need for your data to contain
   just the information you want to show
-> Keep in mind the principle of making the important visible: Is any of your data unnecessary? Should you be doing any simple calculations to emphasize a particular point?
2. When it's ready, export your dataset to a CSV and add it to your
   visualization repo
