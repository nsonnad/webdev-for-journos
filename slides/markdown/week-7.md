# Week 7: It's time to make something

---

# Some changes to our class and meta-discussion

- What has worked so far?
  - Follow-alongs
  - Working on your own
  - freeCodeCamp
  - Classroom flip?

---

# Let's talk about data visualization

---

# What is data visualization?

- A "dataset" contains a lot of information. Too much for our measley brains
- A visualization can help us summarize that data and create an easily
  digestible narrative
- (And if your viz has no clear narrative, it may need some rethinking...)

---

# Kia/Hyundai car thefts

- Spreadsheet version vs [chart version](https://usafacts.org/data-projects/car-thefts)

---

# "Visualization" is an extremely broad term

- It can take a number of different forms (see Kia/Hyundai example)
- But always it is about turning data into something visual and digestible

# Exploring the many dataviz forms

# So how to decide which visualization type to use??

The factors are:

- What type of data you have
- **What you are trying to show**

---

# "What am I trying to show?" is the key question

- Like a paragraph, a chart should make a point clearly

---

# But also, the type of data you have will somewhat determine your options

Types of data:

- Numeric
- Categorical
- Time
- Geographic
- Relationships

Let's explore [data-to-viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) some more

# Goal for upcoming three classes: adapt an open-source D3 chart to your own data

- Source: [D3 Graph Gallery](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/)

---

# What we're going to do

1. Identify a dataset and an appropriate visualization for it
2. Copy the code from D3 Graph Gallery and make it work for your dataset
3. Add a paragraph of context for the chart, along with a headline and byline
4. Add whatever CSS you want to make it look nice
5. Publish!

We'll work on this in class while continuing to do D3 exercises at home
