# Our last week!

---

# What we achieved this semester

---

# Learned JavaScript!

- What it's like to use it
- What it can do
- Comfort with syntax, reading code, identifying bugs
- Making use of powerful programming features like functions, data types (string vs. number vs. date etc), libraries (e.g. D3), and more

---

# Understanding data visualization

- How to think about telling visual stories with data
- Dataviz theory and how to apply it to journalism
- Understanding the mechanics of dataviz, whether for custom graphics or standard charts

---

# Understanding the web

- Greater familiarity making websites with HTML, CSS, JS, GitHub
- Making use of SVG for web graphics

---

# Bringing it all together with D3

- Using D3 to tell stories with data, using JS
- Familiarity with D3 code and concepts (data joins, selections, scales, axes, SVG)

---

# Where to go from here?

---

# Lots of free resources for continuing to learn web development and dataviz

---

# D3

- [D3 in depth](https://www.d3indepth.com/)
- [D3 Tips and Tricks](https://leanpub.com/d3-t-and-t-v7)
- [Data Visualization YouTube Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9yYRbwpkykvOXrZumtZWbuaXWHvjD8gi)

---

# General JavaScript

- [freeCodeCamp: JS algorithms and data structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)
- Many, many books and YouTube videos on virtually any topic

---

# Discussion: the many forms of "data journalist"

- Dataviz / graphics
- Web apps
- Data analysis / stats
- Databases / data collection

---

# My suggestion: If you can, find ways to work on projects

- DIY: Something like a blog but for data stories
- Pitch data stories and learn as you go
- There's no replacement for working on an actual project (anecdote)

# Where do you all want to go from here? What is feeling inspiring?

# How can I help? Questions? Curiousities?
